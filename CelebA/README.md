[Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

### Details
**CelebA** is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than **200K** celebrity images, <br>
each with **40** attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations<br>
and background clutter. CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations,<br>
including<br>
**10,177** number of identities,<br>
**202,599** number of face images, and<br>
**5** landmark locations, **40** binary attributes annotations per image.<br>
<br>
The dataset can be employed as the training and test sets for the following computer vision tasks: <br>
face attribute recognition,<br>
face detection, and<br>
landmark (or facial part) localization.<br>
